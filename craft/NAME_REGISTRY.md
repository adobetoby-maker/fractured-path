# Name Registry — The Fractured Path

Canonical record of every personal name and place name that has appeared on the page
across the four drafted books (96 chapters, ~438,900 words). Built to make the
Mira→Karis / Venmire→Fenmark repair (see `git log`: "Pre-Book 3 planning: rename
Mira->Karis and Venmire->Fenmark to fix name collisions") the **last** ad-hoc fix.

Method: grep-extracted every capitalized token across
`books/book-0{1,2,3,4}-*/chapters/chapter-*.md`, frequency-ranked per book, then
hand-classified into person / place / Path-type / role-title / calendar term by
reading first-use context for every non-trivial hit. Path names (Ember, Blade,
Tide, Wind, Force, Stone, Shield, Ash, Rune, Glass, Mire, Shadow, Skin,
Compression, Pressure…) and role-titles (Warden, Magister, Chancellor, Registrar,
Archmarshal, Provost, Arbiter, Assessor, Ledger-keeper, Instructor) are **excluded**
from the collision analysis — see Header Rules — because they repeat by design.

---

## Rules for Books 5–15 (read before naming anyone)

1. **Check this registry before naming any character or place.** No name below —
   in the Personal Names or Place Names tables of any book — may be reused for a
   *different* entity going forward.
2. **Aural distinctness is required, not just spelling distinctness.** This series
   ships as audiobook. `Karis` / `Karris` / `Charis`-style pairs are a collision
   even though every letter differs. Judge by ear: read the candidate name and
   every registry name aloud, back to back.
3. **System/skill/Path names are out of scope for this rule.** Ember, Blade,
   Tide, Force, Wind, Stone, Shield, Ash, Rune, Skin, Shadow, Glass, Mire,
   Compression, Pressure, and future Path names may repeat freely — that's the
   point of a shared classification system. Don't flag "two characters both have
   a Force Path" as a collision.
4. **Role-titles are not names.** Warden, Magister, Chancellor, Registrar,
   Archmarshal, Provost, Arbiter, Assessor, Ledger-keeper, Instructor, Registrar,
   Magistrate — reusing a title for a new office-holder is fine and expected.
   Flag it only if the *name attached to the title* collides (e.g., a future
   "Warden Voss" would collide with "Petra Voss" AND rhyme against "Warden Coss").
5. **When in doubt, run the two greps below before drafting a new-book chapter:**
   ```bash
   grep -rniE "\bCANDIDATE[a-z']*\b" books/book-0*/chapters/*.md
   grep -rniE "\bCLOSE-SOUNDING-VARIANT\b" books/book-0*/chapters/*.md
   ```
6. **Disposition (rename vs. accept) is the lead's call.** This document flags;
   it does not fix.

---

## RESERVED — never use (Boundary universe cross-contamination risk)

These belong to the sibling Boundary-universe's major cast. Cross-universe
listener confusion (shared audiobook audience) makes them permanently off-limits
here, regardless of spelling variants:

**Kade, Mercer, Mara, Vey, Aaron, Sen, Holden, Elena, Julian, Cross, Sera, Eli, Taren**

Verified clean: none of the 13 reserved names appear anywhere in the 96 drafted
chapters as a character or place (`grep -rlE "\b<name>\b" books/book-0*/chapters/*.md`
→ zero hits for all 13; the single incidental match on "Cross" was the common word
in "Cross-referenced," not a name — book-02 chapter-14 line 75).

---

## Rename Verification — Mira→Karis, Venmire→Fenmark

```bash
grep -rniE "\bmira[a-z]*\b" books/book-0{1,2,3,4}-*/chapters/*.md | grep -viE "admira|miracl"
grep -rniE "\bvenmire\b" books/book-0{1,2,3,4}-*/chapters/*.md
```

**Result: CLEAN. Zero stragglers in either grep, across all 96 chapters.**
No surviving "Mira" (excluding "admiral"-family false positives, of which there
were none anyway) and no surviving "Venmire." Both renames were applied
completely before Book 3 drafting began, consistent with the commit message.
`Fenmark` itself does not appear in Book 1 at all (0 hits) — confirming Venmire/
Fenmark is a Book 2+ item, not retrofitted into Book 1.

## Collision Table — worst first

| # | Severity | Names | Books/chapters | Why it's a collision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **HIGH** | `Vell` (person) vs. `Velmere` (place) | Vell: bk1 ch06-24 (12ch, major), bk2-4 minor recurring. Velmere: bk2 ch08 (Brom's home estate), referenced bk2-4. | Near-identical onset — "Velmere" is literally "Vell" + "-mere." Both are said aloud repeatedly in unrelated contexts (Vell = the Ledger-keeper who runs Cael's early circuit matches; Velmere = Brom's family estate, introduced in Brom's ch8 backstory). An audiobook listener has no orthographic cue to disambiguate "at Velmere" from a clipped "at Vell's" — both are plausible mishearings of each other. |
| 2 | **HIGH** | `Corvane` (person) / `Greyvane` (place) / `Halcenvane` (place) — the "-vane" cluster | Corvane: bk1 ch16 (Pressure-Path instructor, minor). Greyvane: bk2 ch22 onward, major Academy setting bk3, referenced bk4 (75+ hits). Halcenvane: bk4 ch01 onward, major Academy setting bk4 (55+ hits). | Three distinct proper nouns sharing the "-vane" suffix, two of them (Greyvane, Halcenvane) both being *academy names* that the plot repeatedly sets in direct contrast to each other in Book 4 ("Greyvane had been a converted waystation... Halcenvane had been built"). A listener switching between "Greyvane" and "Halcenvane" mid-scene is a real risk; Corvane (a one-scene instructor) risks being misheard as a third academy reference entirely. |
| 3 | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | `Ardenmere` vs. `Velmere` — the "-mere" place-name pair | Ardenmere: bk1-4, the primary city (400+ hits total). Velmere: bk2-4, Brom's estate. | Second overlapping collision axis for Velmere (see #1) — both places end in "-mere," and Ardenmere is the single most-repeated proper noun in the series after the core cast. Compounds the Vell/Velmere problem: a listener has three "Vel-/-mere" sounding proper nouns (Vell, Velmere, Ardenmere) circulating simultaneously. |
| 4 | **MEDIUM** | `Coss` (person, major) vs. `Voss` (person, one-off background — "Petra Voss," bk1 ch09 notebook entry) | Coss: bk1-4 recurring, one of the most frequent proper nouns in the series (Warden Coss, Compact investigator). Voss: single mention. | Exact one-syllable rhyme (/kɒs/ vs. /vɒs/), differing only in the initial consonant. Low frequency of "Voss" mitigates real-world risk, but an exact rhyme against a top-tier recurring name is worth a permanent flag — do not promote any "Voss" character in a later book. |
| 5 | **MEDIUM** | `Wray` (person, Instructor at Greyvane) vs. "Grey-" in `Greyvane` (place) | Wray: bk3 ch02 (Instructor, Shield Path). Greyvane: the academy she teaches at. | "Wray" is a homophone of "Grey" (/reɪ/ vs. /ɡreɪ/ — near-identical, differing by the leading /ɡ/). Instructor Wray works *at* Greyvane, so both terms land in the same scenes — "Wray said..." next to "at Greyvane" is a plausible in-scene mishearing. |
| 6 | **MEDIUM** | `Bracken` (person, major, Registrar at Halcenvane) vs. `Brom` (person, major throughout) | Bracken: bk4, major. Brom: bk2-4, major (one of the core four). | Shared "Br-" onset on two frequently-spoken names that both appear heavily in Book 4 dialogue. Not a rhyme, but a shared strong onset on two high-frequency names raises real audiobook risk. |
| 7 | **LOW-MEDIUM** | `Fiske` (person, bk4 champion) vs. `Feryn` (person, bk1-4 recurring circuit opponent) | Fiske: bk4, Copper Crown champion. Feryn: bk1 ch16 onward, recurring minor opponent through bk4. | Both short F+vowel+consonant names of similar shape and length; low overlap in scene-proximity so far, but worth tracking if either character's role grows. |
| 8 | **LOW-MEDIUM** | `Ephram` (person, bk4) vs. `Edran` (person, bk3) | Ephram: bk4 ch03 onward. Edran: bk3 ch04 onward, minor recurrence bk4. | Both two-syllable E-names with a medial "r" and similar cadence (Eph-ram / Ed-ran). Do not appear in the same book's main cast simultaneously as major figures, which lowers risk, but they do co-occur lightly in bk4 (Edran 4 hits, Ephram 16 hits). |
| 9 | **LOW** | `Reydan` (person, bk2 major antagonist) vs. `Renn` (person, bk1 minor circuit opponent) | Reydan: bk2 ch18-24 (52 hits), referenced bk3-4. Renn: bk1 ch08-16 (19 hits), one mention bk2. | Shared "Re(y)n-" onset; different enough in full shape (two vs. one syllable core) that this is a low-priority flag, but the shared prefix sound is worth noting given Reydan's prominence. |
| 10 | **LOW** | `Halvern` (person, bk1 one-scene clerk) vs. `Havel` (person, bk2-4 recurring Assessor) | Halvern: bk1 ch13 only. Havel: bk2 ch07 onward, recurring official through bk4. | Shared "Hav-/Hal-" pattern with V/L consonant proximity. Halvern's single-scene appearance keeps this low priority, but a future book should not introduce a third "Hal-/Hav-" official name. |
| 11 | **LOW** | `Karis` (person, major, bk3-4) vs. `Kestrel` (person, bk1 one-off) | Karis: bk3-4, one of the core four (post-rename from Mira). Kestrel: bk1 ch16-17 only, a circuit fighter Cael studies. | Shared hard "K" onset on an unstressed second syllable; no chapter overlap between the two (Kestrel is bk1-only, Karis begins bk3), which keeps live-scene collision risk at zero currently — flagged only because Karis is now a permanent core-cast name and any future "K—" name should be checked against it by ear. |
| 12 | **LOW (mitigated)** | `Baro` (person, bk1 one-off notebook entry) vs. `Brom` (person, major, bk2-4) | Baro: single notebook entry, bk1 ch09, no surname given, never reappears. | Loose B-r-consonant-vowel skeleton resemblance; Baro's total absence after one background mention makes this a non-issue in practice, listed only for completeness since Brom is a top-tier name going forward. |

**Not flagged, checked and cleared:** Naveth/Havel, Prynn/Quenna, Gault/Coss,
Withrow/Rooke, Rooke/Reydan, Seln/Vell, Vastin/Vell — all read distinctly aloud
and don't share onset, rhyme, or syllable-count patterns strongly enough to log.

## Book 4 — Copper Crown (24 chapters)

**POV:** Primarily Cael. Interludes: ch05 ("Seln") — confirmed Seln POV; ch17
("Archmarshal") — confirmed POV shift, almost certainly Vastin (opening describes
"forty years" of career discipline and reviewing an adjudication transcript —

## Calendar / non-name vocabulary (excluded from tables, noted for completeness)

The series uses in-world day/season names that are capitalized but are **not**
personal or place names: `Thirdweek`, `Fourthweek` (bk1); `Second-day` through
`Seventh-day` (bk4); `Sowing`, `Reaping` (bk4, season/month names in the charter-
inspection timeline). Future books should keep this vocabulary distinct from any
character or place name — do not name a character "Reaping" or similar.

## Dispositions (lead, 2026-08-30) — principle: rename the cheaper side; book 1 has full audio and is frozen until a re-record

| Collision | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Vell / Velmere | Rename VELMERE (estate; 20 uses, books 2-4, no audio). Vell is a 256-use major across all four books incl. audio — untouchable. New estate name must not begin with Vel-/Vell- sounds. |
| Corvane / Greyvane / Halcenvane | Keep GREYVANE (202 uses) as the canonical -vane. Rename HALCENVANE (90 uses, book 4 only) — it is directly contrasted with Greyvane in dialogue, the worst place for rhyming institutions. Corvane (13 uses, book 1 only) is audio-frozen: docket for the book-1 re-record, low priority since it never shares a scene with Greyvane. |
| Ardenmere / Velmere | Resolved by the Velmere rename above. Ardenmere keeps. |
| Coss / Voss | Rename VOSS (1 use, book 1) at the book-1 re-record; until then acceptable — a one-off walk-on. Coss is a 259-use antagonist and keeps. |
| Wray / Greyvane | Rename WRAY (44 uses, books 3-4, no audio) — an instructor AT Greyvane whose name rhymes with the school is a genuine listener trap. |
| Bracken / Brom | Both book-4-era; Brom (766 uses) keeps. Rename BRACKEN (101 uses, book 4 only). |
| LOW pairs (Fiske/Feryn, Ephram/Edran, Reydan/Renn, Halvern/Havel, Karis/Kestrel, Baro/Brom) | Accept as-is; distinct enough at audiobook speed. Revisit only if a narrator stumbles. |

Renames are EXECUTED per-book by the editor loop before that book's audio pass,
never ad hoc: books 2-4 renames (Velmere, Halcenvane, Wray, Bracken) happen
before Book 2's audio begins; book-1 items (Corvane, Voss) ride the eventual
ch1-3 re-record. New names are chosen at execution time against this registry's
aural-distinctness rule — do not pre-mint them here and let them go stale.
